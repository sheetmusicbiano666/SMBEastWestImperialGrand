## About this soundfont

The SMB Yamaha C10 Grand Piano is sampled from the well-known EastWest Yamaha C7 Grand Piano. This soundfont is specifically optimized and equalized to be used for Black MIDI playback, but can also work well on other cases (such as live piano playback or piano transcriptions). The soundfont consists of 88 lossless FLAC samples, for the best sound quality possible. There are a total of 16 default dynamic velocity layers for realism, as well as a preset pack with 128 velocity layers. You can edit this SoundFont on "NotePad" or "Sublime Text" and find a total of 16 SFZ presets, so you can find exactly the sound you are looking for! There are also some interesting addon packs. One of them is a selection of string samples mixed with the piano to give it a “dreamy” or “fantasy” feel, while the other one uses the samples from the infamous Yamaha C7 Piano soundfont, as well as its fantasy sound pack.
